### [Fraudiscern](https://github.com/Eliseowzy/Fraudiscern)
#### What is fraudiscren?
##### Backgrounds
- Financial fraud control is important.
- There are just few open source systems.
- Most jobs are just doing "data analysis", rather than a whole cycle of product.
- Closeness of data makes it rather difficult to train a model or develop a system.
- We are building a bridge, despite the closeness of existing systems and datasets.
##### Features
- Customizable: Fraudiscren is an open platform, permits users load data set or implement machine learning model by - themselves.
- Accessible: Fraudiscren is a user-friendly web platform, no need for much code -- UI can help non-programmer start fraud control smoothly.
- Reliable: Fraudiscern is implemented based on Hadoop distributed ecosystem, which can handle tens of millions of records in real time. Meanwhile, it also supports off-line batch data warehouse.
##### Ongoing
- We have implemented a [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StYokYrgJ30) of fraudiscren.
- The [poster](https://wp.cs.hku.hk/2020/msp20074/real-time-financial-fraud-detection/) of fraudiscern.
